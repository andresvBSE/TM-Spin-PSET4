    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a spindoctor for one of the UK parties. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Develop a dictionary of \"spin\" that politicians have developed in their tweets, i.e. terms that politicians adopt to push specific issues or wordings that stick and influence the debate on an issue. Explain how you construct your dictionary and why this captures the idea of spin.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Apply your dictionary to the larger UK tweet repository - do you find the result satisfactory? Can you show an example of how your political party tried to push an agenda with different members of parliament at the same time?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Try to capture the effect of spin on interactions on twitter. Think about a regression framework that would allow you to control for confounders. This will be highly imperfect no matter what you do, given the time-span of the data, but try to do the best you can.\n",

    "### Part 1 - constructing a dictionary \n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to look at tweets from the UK Labour Party to construct our dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus of tweets is over a relatively small window of time, so constructing a dictionary of political spin will be highly context specific. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary we have extracted from the corpus is based on the 'vomit principle', where politicians repeat a term often enough for it to become part of the public discourse. In practice, this means extracting short-phrases repeated frequently by labour politicians and using those to construct a dictionary that identifies tweets that are likely to be related to spin. As we will see below, this successfully identifies some topics at the time that could be viewed as 'scandals' that the Labour party used to try and damage the Conservative party. Given the relatively limited number of tools we have developed so far and the complexity of identifying political spin without some sort of labelled dataset, this is an appropriate approximation for our dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an additional exercise, we use media attachments as a proxy to label tweets as spin and repeat our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall we find under both methods that tweets labelled as spin show a large statistically signficant increase in interactions (measured as likes, quotes, retweets and replies). The results are more convincing for the dictionary, which labels a larger number of tweets as spim. The method using media attachments also showed an increase in interactions for likes and replies, though are estimates were not precise enough to say anything concrete about the other types of interactions. \n",

    "First, we clean up the text body of the tweets, which included removing user mentions and emojis. We then vectorize the data, extracting ngrams of length 4. This was a hyperparameter that we tuned, and lengths 4-6 identified similar events that could be characterised as spin in our corpus. We then took the 100 most common ngrams of length 4 and assign the dictionary as the unique words in these ngrams. The dictionary appears as a list below: "

We focus on the likes to measure interactions as it is the most popular interaction among users. However, we also repeat our analysis on other measures of interaction like quotes, replies and retweets.\n",
